# fusion-03

On this branch, we've created and customized a new layout, `basic.jsx`, which lets us add semantic markup to our pages.

## User story
As a user, I would like to be able to add a layout to my page, in order to give my page some structure and semantic HTML.

## New Files on this branch

## What's next?
Your next task is to create a new feature. Switch to branch `fusion-04` to see the completed code for the next step.

If you are continuing this training from the last user story, then keep working on your current branch USERNAME-fusion-training.

If you are starting this training from the fourth user story (task Fusion-04), then follow the steps under "What's next?" on the README file in the (https://github.com/wapopartners/Fusion-Training-User-Stories/blob/fusion-01/README.md)[fusion-01] branch - but checkout from fusion-03 instead.
