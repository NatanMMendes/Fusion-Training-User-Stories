# fusion-17

## User story
As a user, I would like to be able to have more control of how a feature will render by explicitly check the output type

## Concepts
- Using app context with multiple output types

## New files:
-  `components/features/global/alert-bar/amp.jsx`

## Updated Files:
-  `components/features/article/header/default.jsx`

## What's next
Just like that, our site now supports AMP! Let's learn a little bit more about how output types work together. Switch to `fusion-17` to learn more.
