# fusion-08

On this branch, we have created our `content-api` content source using the content base added in our .env file so that we can see content making it into our feature pack using the debugger tool exposed in the PageBuilder UI.

## User story
As a user, I would like to fetch content from an API into my feature pack.

## Concepts
- Content sources
- Content Base
- Content Schema

## New Files on this branch
- `/content/sources/content-api.js`
- `/content/schemas/article.js`
- `.env`

## Changed files:
- none

## What's next?
Now that we have access to content, it's time to update our feature to render this via PageBuilder. Switch to branch `fusion-09` to learn more about this next step.

If you are continuing this training from the last user story, then keep working on your current branch USERNAME-fusion-training.

If you are starting this training from the ninth user story (task Fusion-09), then follow the steps under "What's next?" on the README file in the (https://github.com/wapopartners/Fusion-Training-User-Stories/blob/fusion-01/README.md)[fusion-01] branch - but checkout from fusion-08 instead.

## New Task: User Story 09
As a user, I would like to be able to pipe content into my feature so that it renders information from an API.
