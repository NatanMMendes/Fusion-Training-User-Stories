# fusion-12
On this branch, we won't actually be making any code changes! It's just here for continuity with the other tasks and concepts.

## User story
As a user, I would like to be able to render many pieces of content via this template in the browser.

## Concepts
- Resolvers

## New Files on this branch
- None

## Changed files:
- None

## What's next?
Now that we can render complex features, it's time to add some complexity to our layouts. We'll do that by introducing a new type of component: Chains. Switch to branch `fusion-13` to see how!
