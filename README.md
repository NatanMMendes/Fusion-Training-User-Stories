# Welcome to Fusion!

This repository contains all of the code necessary to complete each of the steps in the Arc PageBuilder Fusion training curriculum.

## How to use
This repo contains one branch for each of the user stories in the Fusion training curriculum. Each branch represents a single step in the lessons, so that you can easily follow along and switch branches to get the latest code for a step if you fall behind.

Each branch name corresponds to the last completed step in the code on the branch. For example, if you're beginning the Fusion-04 user story, you'll switch to branch `fusion-03`. However, if you want to see the completed files for Fusion-04, switch to branch `fusion-04`.

It's important to note that the code in this repo may differ from the code written on-the-spot in your training session. However, the files will contain the same information and represent a complete version of each concept.

## What next?
If you are continuing this training from the last user story, then keep working on your current branch USERNAME-fusion-training.

If you are starting this training from the second user story (task Fusion-02), then:

1. Clone this repo
```
git clone git@github.com:wapopartners/Fusion-Training-User-Stories.git
```

2. Checkout to the fusion-01 branch (this will give you all the completed work for task Fusion-02)
```
git checkout fusion-01
```

3. Checkout to your own branch from here
```
git checkout -b USERNAME-fusion-training
```

4. Install all packages/dependencies
```
npm install
```

5. Start fusion
```
npx fusion start
```


## TASK: User Story 02
As a user, I would like to be able to render content via a default output type, which allows me to customize the head and foot of my page.
