# fusion-11
On this branch, we have add our `/article/header` feature and configured it to render using global content.

## User story
As a user, I would like to configure my feature to use a single global content source.

## Concepts
- Global Gontent
- App Context

## New Files on this branch
- `components/features/article/header/default.jsx`

## Changed files:
- none

## What's next?
Now that we have a feature that renders based on the global content instead of being fixed to component level content, we want to see how we can dynamically route content using PageBuilder templates. Switch to branch `fusion-12` to learn more about this next step.

## New Task: User Story 12
As a user, I would like to be able to render many pieces of content via this template in the browser.
