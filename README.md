# fusion-05

On this branch, we have updated our `/sample/color-block` feature to render server side only.

## User story
As a user, I would like to render my feature server side only to improve page performance.

## Concepts
- Server Side vs. Isomorphic vs. Client side rendering

## New Files on this branch
- none!

## Changed files:
- `/components/features/sample/color-block/default.jsx`

## What's next?
One of the many features of PageBuilder is the ability to allow non-technical users to customize the appearance or functionality of their pages without requiring a developer. In the next step, we'll learn how we, as developers, can make such functionality available in the PageBuilder UI based on a set of options. Switch to branch `fusion-06` to see the completed code for this next step.
