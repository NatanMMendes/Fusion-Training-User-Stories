# Fusion-02
On this branch, we've updated the `default` output type, introducing ourselves to some core PageBuilder concepts. Without an output type, PageBuilder can't render anything!

## User Story
As a user, I would like to be able to render content via a default output type, which is natively recognized by PageBuilder and allows me to customize the head and foot of my page.

## Concepts
- Output Types

## New Files
- None

## Changed Files
- `/components/output-types/default.jsx`

## What's next?
An output type provides a common backbone for all of our pages, so now we'll explore how we can start adding some semantic HTML and customization. The first concept to tackle in this regard is layouts. Switch to `fusion-03` to view a completed layout.
