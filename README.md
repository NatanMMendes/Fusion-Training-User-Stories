## Lab 01
As a user, I would like to be able to render content via a default output type, which allows me to customize the head of my page. Without an output type, PageBuilder can't render anything! For more details on output types, [click here](https://redirector.arcpublishing.com/alc/arc-products/pagebuilder/fusion/documentation/recipes/creating-using-output-types.md?version=2.6).

1. Open `components > output-types > default.jsx`
2. Update the title metadata tag in the `<head>` of the page
3. Once you save your file, fusion should automatically pick up the changes.
4. Visit `http://localhost/pagebuilder/pages
5. Click on `Create Page` and give it a name and path like `firstpage`
6. Click on the globe icon on the left, and click on `Share & Publish`
7. Then you can visit `http://localhost/pf/firstpage/?_website=demo` and you should see your new page published. You will not see any content display, but you should see your updated page title display in the browser tab.
