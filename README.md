# fusion-07

On this branch, we have updated our `/sample/color-block` feature to offer PageBuilder users the ability to customize the feature using Custom Fields.

## User story
As a user, I would like to customize the appearance or functionality of my feature in the PageBuilder UI based on a set of options.

## Concepts
- Custom Fields
- Fusion Context

## New Files on this branch
- None

## Changed files:
- `/components/features/sample/color-block/default.jsx`

## What's next?
So far, we have updated our output type to modify our head and footer on the page, created a basic layout to provide semantic html to our page, and began creating and modifying features using custom fields from
Fusion's component context. Let's practice with an exercise - creating an alert bar! Switch to `exercise-01` to see one example implementation.

If you are continuing this training from the last user story, then keep working on your current branch USERNAME-fusion-training.

If you are starting this training from the seventh user story (task Fusion-07), then follow the steps under "What's next?" on the README file in the (https://github.com/wapopartners/Fusion-Training-User-Stories/blob/fusion-01/README.md)[fusion-01] branch - but checkout from fusion-06 instead.

## New Task: User Story 07


## Guide
Building on the alert bar feature from `exercise-01` we provide another way of interacting through inline editing

1. Complete the user story from branch `exercise-01`. ```git checkout exercise-01```

2. You should now have a working `alert-bar` feature.
