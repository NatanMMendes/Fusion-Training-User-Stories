# Welcome to Fusion!

This repository contains all of the code necessary to complete each of the steps in the Arc PageBuilder Fusion training curriculum.

## How to use
This repo contains one branch for each of the user stories in the Fusion training curriculum. Each branch represents a single step in the lessons, so that you can easily follow along and switch branches to get the latest code for a step if you fall behind.

Each branch name corresponds to the last completed step in the code on the branch. For example, if you're beginning the Fusion-04 user story, you'll switch to branch `fusion-03`. However, if you want to see the completed files for Fusion-04, switch to branch `fusion-04`.

It's important to note that the code in this repo may differ from the code written on-the-spot in your training session. However, the files will contain the same information and represent a complete version of each concept.

## What next?
To use this repo, clone the repo to your local machine and check out a new branch (any name is fine) from `master`. This is the starting point for [user story](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18W2lXAE9Y5HmidFF_b2zSv55lNSXREIJnLFhmGy_XRY/edit?usp=sharing) Fusion-01.
