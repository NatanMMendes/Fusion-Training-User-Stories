# fusion-07

On this branch, we have updated our `/sample/color-block` feature to offer PageBuilder users the ability to customize the feature using Custom Fields.

## User story
As a user, I would like to customize the appearance or functionality of my feature in the PageBuilder UI based on a set of options.

## Concepts
- Custom Fields
- Fusion Context

## New Files on this branch
- None

## Changed files:
- `/components/features/sample/color-block/default.jsx`

## What's next?
So far, we have updated our output type to modify our head and footer on the page, created a basic layout to provide semantic html to our page, and began creating and modifying features using custom fields from
Fusion's component context. Let's practice with an exercise - creating an alert bar! Switch to `exercise-01` to see one example implementation.
