# fusion-16

## User story
As a user, I would like to configure my site to render different content for different outputs such as Google AMP.

## Concepts
- Working with multiple output types

## New files:
- `/components/output-types/amp.jsx`
- `/components/features/sample/color-block/amp.jsx`

## What's next
Just like that, our site now supports AMP! Let's learn a little bit more about how output types work together. Switch to `fusion-17` to learn more.
