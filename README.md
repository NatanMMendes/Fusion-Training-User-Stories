# fusion-07

On this branch, we have updated our `/global/alert-bar` feature that we created in `exercise-01` to offer PageBuilder users the ability to edit their feature inline in the admin preview pane.

## User story
As a user, I would like to directly customize my feature using inline editing for a streamlined experience.

## Concepts
- Inline Editing

## New Files on this branch
- None

## Changed files:
- `/components/features/global/alert-bar/default.jsx`

## What's next?
Your next task is to update your feature to dynamically pipe content by exposing a content config to the PageBuilder user. Switch to branch `fusion-08` to see the completed code for the next step.

If you are continuing this training from the last user story, then keep working on your current branch USERNAME-fusion-training.

If you are starting this training from the eighth user story (task Fusion-08), then follow the steps under "What's next?" on the README file in the (https://github.com/wapopartners/Fusion-Training-User-Stories/blob/fusion-01/README.md)[fusion-01] branch - but checkout from fusion-07 instead.

## New Task: User Story 08
As a user, I would like to fetch content from an API into my feature pack.
