# fusion-14

On this branch, we haveadded multisite mocks and updated our `content-api` content source to pull from multiple sites within an organization to offer PageBuilder users the ability to use the same feature pack for many sites.

## User story
As a user, I would like to use my feature pack for multiple sites within my organization

## Concepts
- Multisite

## New Files on this branch
-  `/mocks/siteservice/api/v3/website`

## Changed files:
- `/content/sources/content-api.js`

## What's next?
Now that we can use the same feature pack for multiple sites, we also need the ability to store site specific information. Switch to branch `fusion-15` to learn more about this next step.
