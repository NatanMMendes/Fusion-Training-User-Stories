# fusion-05

On this branch, we have updated our `/sample/color-block` feature to render server side only.

## User story
As a user, I would like to render my feature server side only to improve page performance.

## Concepts
- Server Side vs. Isomorphic vs. Client side rendering

## New Files on this branch
- none!

## Changed files:
- `/components/features/sample/color-block/default.jsx`

## What's next?
One of the many features of PageBuilder is the ability to allow non-technical users to customize the appearance or functionality of their pages without requiring a developer. In the next step, we'll learn how we, as developers, can make such functionality available in the PageBuilder UI based on a set of options. Switch to branch `fusion-06` to see the completed code for this next step.

If you are continuing this training from the last user story, then keep working on your current branch USERNAME-fusion-training.

If you are starting this training from the sixth user story (task Fusion-06), then follow the steps under "What's next?" on the README file in the (https://github.com/wapopartners/Fusion-Training-User-Stories/blob/fusion-01/README.md)[fusion-01] branch - but checkout from fusion-05 instead.

## New Task: User Story 06
As a user, I would like to customize my feature in the PageBuilder UI based on a set of options.

## Guide
Building from our Color Block feature, we're going to add the ability to set the background color of our div in PageBuilder. However, you can add any customization you'd like

1. From root, change directory into the folder of your feature (from our previous example in fusion-03, that will be `components/features/sample/color-block/`) and open the deafult.jsx file of your component

2.
